DESIGN CHOICES:
I think I coded pretty generally throughout the project and tried to be as efficient with code as possible.
In terms of design choices, I put a lot of the logic into the Game class but decided to have bfs in the ghost
class. Every time move was called on the ghost in the time handler, a lot of information would have to be
passed in as parameters such as the target squares and the ghost itself, but it ultimately allowed for
more general coding.

One notable design choice that I made was to use enums to represent ghost colors so that different methods would
know what ghost to make adjustments to. For example, it allowed me to figure out the direction of a particular
ghost through a switch statement. If the ghost passed through was a redGhost, I could use a switch statement
where the redGhost case would return _redGhostDirection.


KNOWN BUGS:
So my frightened mode bugs out after running for a few seconds and ghosts end up running through walls and
causing the game to freeze, so where I call frightenMode() in the game class, I comment that out and instead
run it on chase mode. The ghosts still turn blue and go back to the pen when pacman collides with them, but
they move in bfs directions, not random directions.

Also, sometimes pacman fails to collide with ghosts even though I move pacman, check collisions, move the ghost,
check collisions. I noticed that this tends to be the case when pacman and the ghost are going around corners,
but I don't know why that happens.

HOURS SPENT:
WAY too many
